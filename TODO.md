# TODO

[ ] Add extra "description" as in chatGPT to guide better chatbot, e.g. to not let it reply about windows if I use Linux.
[ ] Add GPT API interface.
[ ] Check **\#FIXME** about bold and italic text so that it is properly handled in code blocks.
[ ] If the number of requested tokens is too short, and the answer is cut, we can internally handle it to ask to continue. For example, we can check that the answer does not end with a full stop... but it is not a general receipt, it can stop at \`\`\` without full stop.

# Done

February 2, 2024

+ [x] Code blocks \`\`\`xxx\`\`\` are selectable to be copied to the clipboard.
+ [x] As soon as the past history is implemented, the last question is not saved in "questions.txt" file. It should be saved.
+ [x] Make it handle multiline input.
+ [x] Handle better history of the chat: separate questions and answers using prompt_toolkit.

January 31, 2024

+ [x] Handles proper input with tracking of history of questions.

January 30, 2024

+ [x] Keeps dialog history.

January 19, 2024

+ [x] Add possibility to make a dialog by keeping recent messages in the memory. *Fixed on Jan 30, 2024.*
+ [x] Script does not handle \#, \', \", etc in the text of the question, fixed on Jan 31, 2024.

3. Syntaxis with \`xxx\` does not work well, see example:

| Yes, you can set up your environment to use Python 3.10 as your default version |
| when you type python or pip in your terminal or command prompt. This            |
| process is called setting up a Python environment variable. Here's a            |
| step-by-step guide for different operating systems:                             |
| For macOS:                                                                      |
| 1. Install Homebrew (if you haven't already) by running this command in your    |
| terminal: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL                                       |
| https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`            |
| 2. Install Python 3.10 using Homebrew: brew install python@3.10                 |
| 3. Add the Python 3.10 binary to your PATH: `echo 'export                       |
| PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.10/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc` (for Zsh users) or    |
| echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.10/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile    |
| (for Bash users)                                                                |
| 4. Install pip for Python 3.10: `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py |    |
| sudo python3.10`                                                                |
| 5. Make sure pip is linked to Python 3.10: `sudo ln -s                          |
| /usr/local/opt/python@3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pip /usr/local/bin/pip` |
| 6. Test your setup: python --version and pip --version should display           |
| Python 3.10 as the active version.                                              |
| For Windows:                                                                    |
| 1. Download Python 3.10 from the official website, specifically the installer   |
| for Windows, and run it. Make sure to check the box "Add Python 3.10 to PATH"   |
| during the installation process.                                                |
| 2. Install pip for Python 3.10: Open your Command Prompt, type python and       |
| press Enter. In the new Python window, type pip install pip and press Enter.    |
| Close the Python window.                                                        |
| 3. Test your setup: Open a new Command Prompt window and type `python           |
| --version and pip --version` to check that Python 3.10 is indeed the active     |
| version.                                                                        |
| For Linux (non-macOS):                                                          |
| 1. Install Python 3.10 using your package manager. For example, if you're using |
| Ubuntu, type sudo apt install python3.10.                                       |
| 2. Make sure Python 3.10 is the default version: `sudo update-alternatives      |
| --config python`. Choose Python 3.10 as the preferred version.                  |
| 3. Install pip for Python 3.10: `sudo apt install python3.10-venv               |
| python3.10-distutils python3.10-dev and then sudo update-alternatives           |
| --install /usr/bin/pip pip /usr/bin/pip3.10 2`.                                 |
| 4. Test your setup: Open a new terminal window and type python --version and    |
| pip --version to check that Python 3.10 is indeed the active version.           |
